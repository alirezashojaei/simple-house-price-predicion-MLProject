# House Price Prediction ML Project

Welcome to our House Price Prediction ML project! This repository is dedicated to solving the challenge of predicting house prices, benefiting both prospective buyers and sellers. We leverage all available feature variables to thoroughly analyze and forecast housing prices.

## Project Structure

### 1. Notebook Folder: Training ML Model
In this folder, you'll find Jupyter Notebook(s) that detail our machine learning model training process. I explore and utilize various feature variables to create a KNN model for predicting house prices.

### 2. API Folder: RESTful API for House Price Prediction
The API folder contains the necessary code for a RESTful API that leverages the trained model from the notebook. With this API, users can make real-time predictions on housing prices based on the features provided. It serves as a convenient tool for anyone looking to estimate house values.
